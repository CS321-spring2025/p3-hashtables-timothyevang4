This project was rather challenging. It took me a while to get back to coding a command line command again for HashtableExperiment so I needed to review how that is done. Overall, this project is a great way to practice with the different structures of different hashing. 

I couldn't get the AWS to work so I don't have that screenshot. Also something weird was happening when I was trying to compile the java files and so the test weren't working either.
